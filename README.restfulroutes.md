Designing Secure API Endpoints (Members, Articles, Actions, Call-flow) and Unit Tests
The following report outlines new backend RESTful API routes for the Members, Articles, Actions, and Call-flow features, along with role-based access control and planned unit tests. All endpoints are protected by authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) middleware so that only authorized roles (admin and manager) can access them. Each API section lists the routes (with HTTP methods), descriptions, and access permissions. A subsequent section details unit test cases covering authentication, authorization, and route-specific logic for each feature.

Members API
Overview: The Members API manages member profiles in the system. It provides endpoints to create new members and list all members, which will be used by admins or managers for user administration tasks. The API follows standard REST conventions for creating and reading resources. All routes require the client to be authenticated as an admin or manager – other roles or anonymous requests are rejected with appropriate error codes (HTTP 401/403).
Routes and Permissions: The Members API includes two endpoints. Both are restricted to admin and manager roles using RBAC middleware (e.g. a hasRole(['admin','manager']) check):
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Allowed Roles |
| POST | /members | Create a new member profile. Expects member data in the request body and adds a new member to the system (e.g. a new user account). On success, returns the created member object with a 201 Created status. Only accessible to authorized staff. | Admin, Manager |
| GET | /members | Retrieve a list of all member profiles. Returns an array of member objects (e.g. for an admin viewing all user accounts). This operation does not expose sensitive info like passwords. Only accessible to authorized staff. | Admin, Manager |

Security: Both endpoints require a valid authentication token (e.g. JWT) and the user’s role must be admin or manager. If the token is missing or invalid, the server responds with 401 Unauthorized. If the token is valid but the user’s role is insufficient, the server responds with 403 Forbidden. This ensures that only privileged users can create or list members, aligning with the principle of least privilege. The RBAC check is enforced via middleware before reaching the route handlers.

Articles API
Overview: The Articles API manages knowledge base entries (help articles) in the system. Knowledge base articles are documents containing information that agents use to answer customer inquiries. This API supports full CRUD operations – clients can create new articles, retrieve articles (individually or in lists), update them, and delete them. All operations are restricted to admin and manager roles (agents might view articles through a different interface, but this management API is for content administrators only). The design follows RESTful resource conventions: using HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE on a /articles resource path.
Routes and Permissions: The Articles API defines endpoints for each CRUD action on knowledge base articles. All endpoints require admin/manager authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can modify the knowledge base content:
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Allowed Roles |
| GET | /articles | List all knowledge base articles. Returns an array of article entries (each including fields like title, content, category, etc.). Supports knowledge base management interfaces where admins can see all articles. Requires admin/manager role. | Admin, Manager |
| GET | /articles/{id} | Retrieve a specific article by its unique ID. Returns the article object if found, or 404 Not Found if the ID does not exist. Requires admin/manager role. | |
| POST | /articles | Create a new knowledge base article. Expects article data (e.g. title, content, tags) in the request body. On success, stores the article and returns the created resource with a 201 Created status. The new article is immediately available for retrieval. Requires admin/manager role. | |
| PUT | /articles/{id} | Update an existing article by ID (full update). Expects the complete article data in the body; replaces the article’s content in the database. Returns the updated article, or 404 if no article with that ID exists. Only allowed for admin/manager. | |
| DELETE | /articles/{id} | Delete an article by ID. Removes the article from the knowledge base. Returns a success response (e.g. 204 No Content or 200 with a confirmation message) upon deletion, or 404 if the article ID is not found. Only allowed for admin/manager. | |

Security and Data Management: Only authenticated admins or managers can invoke these endpoints. This prevents unauthorized users from altering knowledge base content. By restricting modifications to privileged roles, the integrity and quality of the knowledge base is maintained (agents or regular users typically only read articles via other means, not through this admin API). Each operation checks the user’s role before proceeding. Attempting to perform article operations without proper credentials yields 401/403 errors as appropriate (401 if not logged in, 403 if logged in with insufficient role).
Additionally, basic validations are enforced: for example, the POST/PUT handlers will validate required fields (like title or content) and return 400 Bad Request if data is missing or invalid. When an article is successfully created or updated, it will be time-stamped and stored, making it available for agents to use in assisting customers. The knowledge base articles serve as the primary content for answering FAQs, so ensuring only authorized edits is critical to maintain “organized, up-to-date information” for agents.

Actions API
Overview: The Actions API is designed to associate default knowledge base articles with call reasons. In a call center application, a “call reason” (or call category) represents why the customer is calling (for example, Billing Issue, Technical Support, etc.). This API lets administrators define a default action or reference (here, a knowledge base article) that should be associated with each call reason. The goal is to provide agents with an automatic suggestion of the best knowledge base article for a given call reason, improving response efficiency and consistency. For instance, if the call reason is “Password Reset”, the default action might link to a “How to Reset Your Password” article, so the agent can quickly pull it up.
All Action management endpoints are restricted to admin/manager users. The data model for an “Action” could be something like: an ID, a callReason identifier, and a linked Article identifier (the default article). Only one default article is expected per call reason (the API should enforce or at least administrators should only create one per reason). This API follows REST principles – treating the call reason/article association as a resource that can be created, read, updated, or deleted.
Routes and Permissions: The Actions API provides endpoints to create and manage these associations. All requests require admin or manager privileges:
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Allowed Roles |
| GET | /actions | List all call reason to article associations. Returns an array of objects, each mapping a callReason to a default article (e.g., {reason: "Billing Issue", articleId: 42}). Allows admins to review all defined mappings. | Admin, Manager |
| GET | /actions/{id} | Get a specific association by its ID. Returns the call reason and linked article details if found, or 404 Not Found if the ID doesn’t exist. Useful for checking a particular mapping. | Admin, Manager |
| POST | /actions | Create a new association between a call reason and a default article. Expects a request body with identifiers (e.g., callReasonId and articleId). If the call reason already has an associated article, the API could either return an error or update it (design decision – but typically we avoid duplicates). On success, returns the new association with a 201 Created status. | Admin, Manager |
| PUT | /actions/{id} | Update an existing association. This can be used to change the default article for a given call reason (or correct the call reason field). For example, if the wrong article was linked, an admin can update the mapping to point to a different article. Returns the updated association, or 404 if not found. | Admin, Manager |
| DELETE | /actions/{id} | Delete an association. Removes the link between a call reason and its default article (e.g., if a call reason is being retired or the default article is no longer applicable). Returns a confirmation or 204 No Content on success, or 404 if the association ID is not found. | Admin, Manager |

Behavior: With this API, administrators can ensure that every common call reason has a helpful knowledge base article queued up. This feature empowers agents to find answers “at their fingertips” with minimal searching. For example, when a call is categorized with a certain reason in the call-handling system, the application can automatically fetch the associated default article (via this mapping) and display it to the agent. By managing these mappings centrally, the company’s knowledge managers can continually tune which article best resolves each type of inquiry.
Security: The endpoint security is similar to the others – only authenticated admins/managers may create or modify associations. Unauthorized users cannot change what articles are recommended for calls. If an agent (who is not a manager) attempted to call these APIs, they would get a 403 Forbidden response. This ensures that the curation of default articles for call reasons remains an administrative function.
Data validation: The Actions API will validate that the callReasonId and articleId provided actually refer to existing entries in their respective tables. If an admin tries to link a call reason or article that doesn’t exist, the API should return a 400 Bad Request or 404 (depending on implementation) indicating an invalid reference. This prevents broken links.

Call-flow API
Overview: The Call-flow API manages end-of-call checklists, which are the tasks or checks that agents must complete after finishing a call. In call center operations, after-call work can include updating the CRM, logging the call reason, scheduling follow-ups, or other wrap-up tasks. This API allows the definition and management of these checklists to ensure consistent call closure procedures. For example, an end-call checklist might include items like “Confirm customer’s issue was resolved,” “Mark call reason in system,” “Send follow-up email if required,” etc. By having these as a checklist object, the application’s UI can display them to agents at call completion and record which items were done.
Administrators or managers will use this API to create and update the checklists (for example, if new compliance checks are needed, they can add an item). It may also support multiple checklists if different call types have different wrap-up procedures (in that case, each checklist could be associated with a scenario or call type). All operations are restricted to admin/manager roles for security.
Routes and Permissions: The Call-flow API provides CRUD endpoints to manage checklist definitions. Each checklist might have an ID, a name or call type it applies to (optional), and a list of checklist items (each item could have text description, and maybe an order or flag if required). The endpoints (all admin/manager only) are:
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Allowed Roles |
| GET | /call-flows | List all end-of-call checklists. Returns an array of checklists. If the system uses a single global checklist, this might return just one item. If multiple, each object contains the checklist details (e.g., ID, name, and list of tasks). | Admin, Manager |
| GET | /call-flows/{id} | Retrieve a specific checklist by ID. Returns the checklist (including its list of tasks) if found, or 404 Not Found if the ID doesn’t exist. | Admin, Manager |
| POST | /call-flows | Create a new end-of-call checklist. Expects a request body with the checklist details. For example, an admin can define a new checklist with a set of tasks. The response returns the created checklist with its ID (and tasks) with a 201 Created status on success. | Admin, Manager |
| PUT | /call-flows/{id} | Update an existing checklist by ID. Allows modifying the checklist’s properties or tasks (e.g., adding/removing tasks, or renaming the checklist). Returns the updated checklist, or a 404 if the checklist ID isn’t found. | Admin, Manager |
| DELETE | /call-flows/{id} | Delete a checklist by ID. Removes the checklist from the system (e.g., if that call flow is no longer used). Returns confirmation or 204 No Content if deletion is successful, or 404 if no such checklist exists. | Admin, Manager |

Checklist Content: Each checklist will typically contain multiple items/tasks that an agent should complete during after-call work. The API might treat the entire set of items as part of the checklist resource (for simplicity, tasks could be an array field in the checklist JSON). For example, a GET for a checklist might return:
{
"id": 5,
"name": "Standard Support Call Wrap-Up",
"tasks": [
"Log call outcome in CRM",
"Mention knowledge base article sent to customer in notes",
"Update customer contact info if changed",
"Mark case as resolved or escalate if needed"# Customer Service Helper – API Routes

}

This structure is managed through the above routes. The design ensures that after-call procedures are consistent and centrally maintained. Having a well-defined end-of-call process is a quality assurance measure in call centers, contributing to consistent customer service and data recording.
Security: As with previous APIs, only admins and managers can create or modify checklists. Agents will only view these checklists in the application interface (not via direct API calls to these endpoints). Unauthorized access attempts are handled by returning 401/403 errors. The RBAC middleware will check the user’s role on each request to /call-flows routes to enforce this restriction.
Validation: The API will validate that each checklist contains at least one task (can’t create an empty checklist) and that task descriptions are reasonable length. If a PUT or DELETE is attempted on a non-existent ID, a 404 Not Found is returned, as is standard in REST APIs for missing resources. Creating a new checklist returns 201 with the new resource data.
Usage: Once defined, these checklists can be used by the system’s call-handling module to present the tasks to the agent once a call ends. The agent’s completion of each item might be tracked on the client side, but that is outside the scope of this API (this API is only for defining the template of tasks, not recording each call’s completion – that would be handled by a different part of the system). Still, by managing the checklist via this API, the organization ensures all agents follow the same after-call workflow, which is crucial for operational consistency and compliance.
