🧠 Breakdown of Simultaneous Usage
| Role | Operation Type | Action | Load Pattern |
| Agents (20k) | Validation Reads | Validate members on calls | Read-heavy, bursty |
| Trainers (100) | Article Writes | Add/update training material | Write-heavy, trickle |
| Admins | Article Moderation | Update member records, FAQ, metadata | Mixed read/write |
| Public (10k) | Member Registration | CSV uploads, POSTs | Heavy file parsing, write |
| System | Background Jobs | ImportJob tracking, chunked validation | CPU + DB intensive |

🚦 What Could Go Wrong If You’re Not Ready
❌ Performance issues

- Upload spikes could saturate memory (CSV parsing, validation)
- Read burst could exhaust DB connections (findFirst, findMany)
- Background jobs competing for worker thread cycles
  ❌ Freezing / Crash Triggers
- Unbounded loops or bulk inserts without batching
- Long-running requests holding open API threads
- Uncapped file sizes causing heap pressure

⚙️ How You Defend Against This
Already doing several things to avoid this:
✅ Chunked CSV Uploads

- Processing 500 rows per batch isolates failures and reduces memory pressure
  ✅ Import Job System
- Offloads upload processing from main request flow
- Can be extended to queues (BullMQ, Redis Streams)
  ✅ Role-Based Access
- Agents only get scoped views — prevents accidental heavy queries
  ✅ Input Validation & Rejection
- Malformed rows are discarded before reaching DB

🏗️ What Could Still Be Added
🧵 Add Background Workers

- Use BullMQ or Bree.js to handle ImportJob batches outside HTTP thread
- You can scale horizontally as jobs increase
  📊 Add DB Connection Pool Limits
- Prevent Postgres exhaustion — use PgBouncer or Prisma pool config
  // prisma client
  poolTimeout: 3000,
  connectionLimit: 20

⚠️ Add Rate Limits + Throttling

- Per-org CSV job limits (e.g. 1 per minute)
- Reject surge uploads with 429 Too Many Requests
  🧪 Add Load Testing (Artillery / k6)
- Simulate agents reading members, admins uploading, etc.
- Watch for 5xx errors, latency spikes
