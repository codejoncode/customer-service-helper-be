Routes and Unit tests for Unaccounted Features in Backend

Designing Secure API Endpoints (Members, Articles, Actions, Call-flow) and Unit Tests
The following report outlines new backend RESTful API routes for the Members, Articles, Actions, and Call-flow features, along with role-based access control and planned unit tests. All endpoints are protected by authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) middleware so that only authorized roles (admin and manager) can access them. Each API section lists the routes (with HTTP methods), descriptions, and access permissions. A subsequent section details unit test cases covering authentication, authorization, and route-specific logic for each feature.

Members API
Overview: The Members API manages member profiles in the system. It provides endpoints to create new members and list all members, which will be used by admins or managers for user administration tasks. The API follows standard REST conventions for creating and reading resources. All routes require the client to be authenticated as an admin or manager – other roles or anonymous requests are rejected with appropriate error codes (HTTP 401/403).
Routes and Permissions: The Members API includes two endpoints. Both are restricted to admin and manager roles using RBAC middleware (e.g. a hasRole(['admin','manager']) check):
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Allowed Roles | 
| POST | /members | Create a new member profile. Expects member data in the request body and adds a new member to the system (e.g. a new user account). On success, returns the created member object with a 201 Created status. Only accessible to authorized staff. | Admin, Manager | 
| GET | /members | Retrieve a list of all member profiles. Returns an array of member objects (e.g. for an admin viewing all user accounts). This operation does not expose sensitive info like passwords. Only accessible to authorized staff. | Admin, Manager | 


Security: Both endpoints require a valid authentication token (e.g. JWT) and the user’s role must be admin or manager. If the token is missing or invalid, the server responds with 401 Unauthorized. If the token is valid but the user’s role is insufficient, the server responds with 403 Forbidden. This ensures that only privileged users can create or list members, aligning with the principle of least privilege. The RBAC check is enforced via middleware before reaching the route handlers.

Articles API
Overview: The Articles API manages knowledge base entries (help articles) in the system. Knowledge base articles are documents containing information that agents use to answer customer inquiries. This API supports full CRUD operations – clients can create new articles, retrieve articles (individually or in lists), update them, and delete them. All operations are restricted to admin and manager roles (agents might view articles through a different interface, but this management API is for content administrators only). The design follows RESTful resource conventions: using HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE on a /articles resource path.
Routes and Permissions: The Articles API defines endpoints for each CRUD action on knowledge base articles. All endpoints require admin/manager authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can modify the knowledge base content:
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Allowed Roles | 
| GET | /articles | List all knowledge base articles. Returns an array of article entries (each including fields like title, content, category, etc.). Supports knowledge base management interfaces where admins can see all articles. Requires admin/manager role. | Admin, Manager | 
| GET | /articles/{id} | Retrieve a specific article by its unique ID. Returns the article object if found, or 404 Not Found if the ID does not exist. Requires admin/manager role. |  | 
| POST | /articles | Create a new knowledge base article. Expects article data (e.g. title, content, tags) in the request body. On success, stores the article and returns the created resource with a 201 Created status. The new article is immediately available for retrieval. Requires admin/manager role. |  | 
| PUT | /articles/{id} | Update an existing article by ID (full update). Expects the complete article data in the body; replaces the article’s content in the database. Returns the updated article, or 404 if no article with that ID exists. Only allowed for admin/manager. |  | 
| DELETE | /articles/{id} | Delete an article by ID. Removes the article from the knowledge base. Returns a success response (e.g. 204 No Content or 200 with a confirmation message) upon deletion, or 404 if the article ID is not found. Only allowed for admin/manager. |  | 


Security and Data Management: Only authenticated admins or managers can invoke these endpoints. This prevents unauthorized users from altering knowledge base content. By restricting modifications to privileged roles, the integrity and quality of the knowledge base is maintained (agents or regular users typically only read articles via other means, not through this admin API). Each operation checks the user’s role before proceeding. Attempting to perform article operations without proper credentials yields 401/403 errors as appropriate (401 if not logged in, 403 if logged in with insufficient role).
Additionally, basic validations are enforced: for example, the POST/PUT handlers will validate required fields (like title or content) and return 400 Bad Request if data is missing or invalid. When an article is successfully created or updated, it will be time-stamped and stored, making it available for agents to use in assisting customers. The knowledge base articles serve as the primary content for answering FAQs, so ensuring only authorized edits is critical to maintain “organized, up-to-date information” for agents.

Actions API
Overview: The Actions API is designed to associate default knowledge base articles with call reasons. In a call center application, a “call reason” (or call category) represents why the customer is calling (for example, Billing Issue, Technical Support, etc.). This API lets administrators define a default action or reference (here, a knowledge base article) that should be associated with each call reason. The goal is to provide agents with an automatic suggestion of the best knowledge base article for a given call reason, improving response efficiency and consistency. For instance, if the call reason is “Password Reset”, the default action might link to a “How to Reset Your Password” article, so the agent can quickly pull it up.
All Action management endpoints are restricted to admin/manager users. The data model for an “Action” could be something like: an ID, a callReason identifier, and a linked Article identifier (the default article). Only one default article is expected per call reason (the API should enforce or at least administrators should only create one per reason). This API follows REST principles – treating the call reason/article association as a resource that can be created, read, updated, or deleted.
Routes and Permissions: The Actions API provides endpoints to create and manage these associations. All requests require admin or manager privileges:
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Allowed Roles | 
| GET | /actions | List all call reason to article associations. Returns an array of objects, each mapping a callReason to a default article (e.g., {reason: "Billing Issue", articleId: 42}). Allows admins to review all defined mappings. | Admin, Manager | 
| GET | /actions/{id} | Get a specific association by its ID. Returns the call reason and linked article details if found, or 404 Not Found if the ID doesn’t exist. Useful for checking a particular mapping. | Admin, Manager | 
| POST | /actions | Create a new association between a call reason and a default article. Expects a request body with identifiers (e.g., callReasonId and articleId). If the call reason already has an associated article, the API could either return an error or update it (design decision – but typically we avoid duplicates). On success, returns the new association with a 201 Created status. | Admin, Manager | 
| PUT | /actions/{id} | Update an existing association. This can be used to change the default article for a given call reason (or correct the call reason field). For example, if the wrong article was linked, an admin can update the mapping to point to a different article. Returns the updated association, or 404 if not found. | Admin, Manager | 
| DELETE | /actions/{id} | Delete an association. Removes the link between a call reason and its default article (e.g., if a call reason is being retired or the default article is no longer applicable). Returns a confirmation or 204 No Content on success, or 404 if the association ID is not found. | Admin, Manager | 


Behavior: With this API, administrators can ensure that every common call reason has a helpful knowledge base article queued up. This feature empowers agents to find answers “at their fingertips” with minimal searching. For example, when a call is categorized with a certain reason in the call-handling system, the application can automatically fetch the associated default article (via this mapping) and display it to the agent. By managing these mappings centrally, the company’s knowledge managers can continually tune which article best resolves each type of inquiry.
Security: The endpoint security is similar to the others – only authenticated admins/managers may create or modify associations. Unauthorized users cannot change what articles are recommended for calls. If an agent (who is not a manager) attempted to call these APIs, they would get a 403 Forbidden response. This ensures that the curation of default articles for call reasons remains an administrative function.
Data validation: The Actions API will validate that the callReasonId and articleId provided actually refer to existing entries in their respective tables. If an admin tries to link a call reason or article that doesn’t exist, the API should return a 400 Bad Request or 404 (depending on implementation) indicating an invalid reference. This prevents broken links.

Call-flow API
Overview: The Call-flow API manages end-of-call checklists, which are the tasks or checks that agents must complete after finishing a call. In call center operations, after-call work can include updating the CRM, logging the call reason, scheduling follow-ups, or other wrap-up tasks. This API allows the definition and management of these checklists to ensure consistent call closure procedures. For example, an end-call checklist might include items like “Confirm customer’s issue was resolved,” “Mark call reason in system,” “Send follow-up email if required,” etc. By having these as a checklist object, the application’s UI can display them to agents at call completion and record which items were done.
Administrators or managers will use this API to create and update the checklists (for example, if new compliance checks are needed, they can add an item). It may also support multiple checklists if different call types have different wrap-up procedures (in that case, each checklist could be associated with a scenario or call type). All operations are restricted to admin/manager roles for security.
Routes and Permissions: The Call-flow API provides CRUD endpoints to manage checklist definitions. Each checklist might have an ID, a name or call type it applies to (optional), and a list of checklist items (each item could have text description, and maybe an order or flag if required). The endpoints (all admin/manager only) are:
| Method | Endpoint | Description | Allowed Roles | 
| GET | /call-flows | List all end-of-call checklists. Returns an array of checklists. If the system uses a single global checklist, this might return just one item. If multiple, each object contains the checklist details (e.g., ID, name, and list of tasks). | Admin, Manager | 
| GET | /call-flows/{id} | Retrieve a specific checklist by ID. Returns the checklist (including its list of tasks) if found, or 404 Not Found if the ID doesn’t exist. | Admin, Manager | 
| POST | /call-flows | Create a new end-of-call checklist. Expects a request body with the checklist details. For example, an admin can define a new checklist with a set of tasks. The response returns the created checklist with its ID (and tasks) with a 201 Created status on success. | Admin, Manager | 
| PUT | /call-flows/{id} | Update an existing checklist by ID. Allows modifying the checklist’s properties or tasks (e.g., adding/removing tasks, or renaming the checklist). Returns the updated checklist, or a 404 if the checklist ID isn’t found. | Admin, Manager | 
| DELETE | /call-flows/{id} | Delete a checklist by ID. Removes the checklist from the system (e.g., if that call flow is no longer used). Returns confirmation or 204 No Content if deletion is successful, or 404 if no such checklist exists. | Admin, Manager | 


Checklist Content: Each checklist will typically contain multiple items/tasks that an agent should complete during after-call work. The API might treat the entire set of items as part of the checklist resource (for simplicity, tasks could be an array field in the checklist JSON). For example, a GET for a checklist might return:
{
  "id": 5,
  "name": "Standard Support Call Wrap-Up",
  "tasks": [
    "Log call outcome in CRM",
    "Mention knowledge base article sent to customer in notes",
    "Update customer contact info if changed",
    "Mark case as resolved or escalate if needed"
  ]
}


This structure is managed through the above routes. The design ensures that after-call procedures are consistent and centrally maintained. Having a well-defined end-of-call process is a quality assurance measure in call centers, contributing to consistent customer service and data recording.
Security: As with previous APIs, only admins and managers can create or modify checklists. Agents will only view these checklists in the application interface (not via direct API calls to these endpoints). Unauthorized access attempts are handled by returning 401/403 errors. The RBAC middleware will check the user’s role on each request to /call-flows routes to enforce this restriction.
Validation: The API will validate that each checklist contains at least one task (can’t create an empty checklist) and that task descriptions are reasonable length. If a PUT or DELETE is attempted on a non-existent ID, a 404 Not Found is returned, as is standard in REST APIs for missing resources. Creating a new checklist returns 201 with the new resource data.
Usage: Once defined, these checklists can be used by the system’s call-handling module to present the tasks to the agent once a call ends. The agent’s completion of each item might be tracked on the client side, but that is outside the scope of this API (this API is only for defining the template of tasks, not recording each call’s completion – that would be handled by a different part of the system). Still, by managing the checklist via this API, the organization ensures all agents follow the same after-call workflow, which is crucial for operational consistency and compliance.

Unit Tests for Security and Route Functionality
Overview: A comprehensive suite of unit tests will be written to verify authentication, role-based access control, and route-specific logic for each of the above APIs. The tests aim to ensure the backend is properly locked down and that each route behaves as expected for various scenarios. This includes testing success cases (correct role and valid data) and failure cases (missing auth, wrong role, invalid data, etc.). According to best practices, we will have at least two authorization tests per endpoint (one where access is allowed and one where it’s denied) to cover each route’s security, as well as tests for the core business logic of the route.
Below, we outline the key test cases for each API category:
Members API – Test Cases
- Authentication Required (Create Member): If no authentication token is provided, a POST /members request should be rejected with 401 Unauthorized. Similarly, an expired or invalid token should yield 401. This verifies that authentication is enforced on this route (only logged-in users can hit it).
- Role-Based Access (Create Member): Even with a valid token, if the user’s role is not admin or manager (e.g. a normal agent token), the POST /members should be forbidden with 403. We will test that an “Access denied” error is returned for a user with insufficient privileges. Conversely, a token with an admin role should succeed. (We simulate this by issuing tokens for different roles in the test setup.)
- Authentication Required (List Members): A GET /members call without a valid login should return 401. With login but improper role, it should return 403. These mirror the create-member tests but for the listing endpoint, ensuring both routes are protected by the RBAC middleware.
- Successful Member Creation: Using an admin-role token, POST /members with valid payload (e.g. a new user’s name, email, etc.) should succeed. The test will assert that the response status is 201 Created and that the response body contains the new member’s data (e.g. an ID was generated). We’ll also verify that the member actually appears in the system (e.g. by calling the list API or checking a mock database). This ensures the create logic performs as expected.
- Member Creation Validation: Attempt to create a member with missing required fields (e.g. no name or email) and expect a 400 Bad Request with a validation error message. This checks server-side validation on the create route.
- List Members Output: Using an admin token, GET /members should return a list (array) of members. The test will seed some member entries (or assume the previous creation test added one) and then verify that the list returned contains those entries. We will also ensure that sensitive fields (like password hashes) are not present in the output. This verifies that the listing logic is returning the correct data safely.
- No Access for Non-Admins: (Redundant but important) We may include an extra test where a normal user token tries to call GET /members and confirm again the response is 403 Forbidden, to double-confirm the middleware is consistently applied.
Articles API – Test Cases
- Auth and RBAC on All Operations: Tests will cover that all CRUD endpoints require login and proper role. For example, GET /articles with no token → 401; with a non-manager token → 403. The same pattern for POST /articles, PUT /articles/{id}, and DELETE /articles/{id} – only admin/manager roles should succeed. We will systematically test each endpoint for:
- No auth (expect 401).
- Auth but wrong role (expect 403).
- Auth with correct role (expect success).
- Create Article Success: Using an admin token, send a valid POST /articles with a new article (title, content, etc.). Expect 201 Created and JSON response containing the new article’s data (including an autogenerated ID). Verify that a subsequent GET /articles/{id} returns the same data, confirming the article was saved. This tests both the create logic and that the resource can be retrieved.
- Create Article Validation: Try POST /articles with missing fields (e.g., no title or content) → expect 400 Bad Request with appropriate error. This ensures the validation rules on article creation are enforced.
- Get Article (Existing): Using an admin token, call GET /articles/{id} for an article that exists. Expect 200 OK and the correct article JSON. We can create an article in a beforeEach step or use a fixture, then retrieve it. This checks the read logic.
- Get Article (Not Found): Call GET /articles/99999 (an ID that doesn’t exist in test data) and expect a 404 Not Found response. The test verifies that looking up a nonexistent article returns the proper error status.
- Update Article Success: Create an article, then call PUT /articles/{id} to modify it (e.g., change the title or content). Use an admin token. Expect 200 OK and the response body reflecting the updated article. Then call GET /articles/{id} to confirm the changes persisted. This tests the update functionality.
- Update Article (Not Found): Attempt PUT /articles/12345 for an ID not in the database. Expect 404 Not Found, ensuring the service correctly handles updates to nonexistent resources.
- Delete Article Success: Create a sample article, then call DELETE /articles/{id} with admin auth. Expect a success status (200 OK or 204 No Content). After deletion, a GET /articles/{id} should now return 404 (we’ll assert that). This confirms the delete operation actually removes the article.
- Delete Article (Not Found): Call DELETE on a non-existent article ID and expect 404. This test covers the error path for the delete route.
- List Articles: If multiple articles exist, GET /articles should return all of them. We will seed, say, 3 articles and assert that the GET returns a list of length 3 containing those articles. Also ensure that the response structure (like fields present) is correct and no unauthorized data is leaking. This test validates the listing functionality and response format.
- No Access for Agents (Verification): For thoroughness, tests will again try a normal user (agent role) token on a couple of these routes (e.g., create or delete) to verify they indeed get 403 Forbidden. This double-checks the RBAC enforcement on each Articles API route.
Actions API – Test Cases
- Auth and RBAC Enforcement: As with other APIs, tests first ensure that all Actions routes (GET /actions, POST /actions, etc.) demand authentication and proper role. Without a token → 401; with a non-privileged token → 403. Only admin/manager tokens should be allowed. We will test a non-admin attempting to create an action mapping and expecting a Forbidden error, for example.
- Create Association Success: Using an admin token, test POST /actions with a valid callReason–article mapping. We might need some existing call reason and article IDs (which we can set up as fixtures or mocks). Provide those in the request JSON. Expect 201 Created and response containing the new association (perhaps including its generated ID, the callReasonId, and articleId). Then, immediately do GET /actions or GET /actions/{id} to ensure the new mapping is retrievable and matches what was sent. This verifies the create logic and persistence.
- Create Association Validation: Try to create an association with an invalid payload, e.g., missing the articleId or callReasonId, or using IDs that don’t exist in the related tables. The expected result is a 400 Bad Request (if validation catches missing fields) or possibly a 404/409 if the service checks for existence or uniqueness (for example, if callReasonId isn’t found, it might return 404). We will simulate a couple of bad inputs to ensure the API doesn’t accept them.
- Prevent Duplicates (if applicable): If the design is such that each call reason can only have one default article, we will test that rule. For example, create an association for reason X. Then attempt to create another association for the same reason X (without deleting the first). The expected behavior might be to reject the second with a 409 Conflict or a validation error indicating “call reason already has a default article.” We will assert that the service does not create a duplicate mapping. (If the intended design is to allow multiple articles per reason, then this test is not needed; but from the description, it sounds like one-to-one mapping.)
- List Associations: Seed the system with a few reason→article mappings (either via multiple POSTs or direct setup). Then call GET /actions with admin auth. Expect a list of all mappings. The test will confirm that the count matches what was inserted and that each mapping has the correct data. This ensures the list endpoint returns all associations.
- Retrieve Specific Association: Using a known association ID, call GET /actions/{id}. Expect 200 OK and the correct mapping data for that ID. Also test GET /actions/{id} for an ID that doesn’t exist → expect 404 Not Found.
- Update Association: Create an association, then call PUT /actions/{id} to change, for example, the articleId to a different article for that same call reason. Use admin token. Expect 200 OK and the JSON reflecting the updated mapping. Then GET it to double-check the change. This tests the update route.
- Update Validation: Attempt to update an association with an invalid articleId or callReasonId (like IDs that don’t exist). Expect an error (likely 400 or 404). For instance, if an admin tries to point a call reason to a non-existent article through the update, the service should catch that and respond with an error. The test will simulate that scenario.
- Delete Association: Create a mapping, then call DELETE /actions/{id} with admin credentials. Expect a successful deletion response. Verify by attempting a GET /actions/{id} afterward, which should return 404. If GET /actions is called after deletion, ensure the deleted mapping is gone from the list. This confirms the delete logic.
- Delete Nonexistent: Call DELETE /actions/99999 where no such ID exists. Expect 404 Not Found. This test is straightforward but ensures the route returns the correct status for a missing resource.
- Security Rechecks: As a final measure, use a non-admin token to try and access one of the successful scenarios (like fetching or deleting an action) to confirm it’s still denied. Although we test this generally upfront, we may pepper a few such assertions to catch any route that might accidentally be left unprotected.
Call-flow API – Test Cases
- Auth and RBAC on Call-flow Routes: Tests will assert that all /call-flows endpoints require authentication and admin/manager role. Without auth → 401, with non-manager auth → 403. For example, an agent-role token trying to create or modify a checklist should get a Forbidden response. We will test a read operation and a write operation with improper credentials to ensure none slip through.
- Create Checklist Success: Using a manager token, test POST /call-flows with a new checklist definition. The request body might contain a name and a list of tasks. Expect 201 Created with the new checklist data in the response (including an ID assigned). Verify that calling GET /call-flows/{newId} returns the same checklist. If the checklist has tasks, ensure they are correctly stored and returned. This validates the create functionality for checklists.
- Create Checklist Validation: Attempt to create a checklist with malformed data, e.g., missing a name or tasks array empty. The service should reject this. Expect 400 Bad Request for invalid input. Also, if there are any constraints (like name must be unique), test violating those to see if it correctly errors out (maybe 409 conflict or 400). For instance, if two checklists cannot share the same name, try creating two with the same name and expect a failure on the second.
- List Checklists: If multiple checklists are to be supported, create a couple of checklists (or have fixtures), then call GET /call-flows. Expect an array of checklists. Check that the number matches and that each checklist’s summary is present. If only one global checklist is used in the app, then this endpoint might just return a single entry – in which case, ensure that one is returned properly. This test essentially ensures the listing endpoint is working and only accessible with the right role.
- Retrieve Checklist: Using a valid token, call GET /call-flows/{id} for an existing checklist. Expect 200 OK and the full checklist data (including tasks). Also call it for an ID that doesn’t exist → should yield 404 Not Found (we’ll test a random high ID).
- Update Checklist: Define a checklist, then call PUT /call-flows/{id} to modify it. For example, change the name or modify the tasks (add an extra task in the array). Expect 200 OK and the updated checklist in the response. Then GET it to ensure the changes persisted. This verifies the update logic. We will also test partial updates if our API allows (if we decided only full updates via PUT, then we ensure full replacement works).
- Update Checklist Validation: Try to update a checklist with invalid data (e.g., set tasks to an empty list, which might be against rules) and expect a 400. Or try updating a non-existent checklist ID and expect 404.
- Delete Checklist: Create a test checklist, then call DELETE /call-flows/{id} on it. Expect successful deletion (200 or 204). After that, GET /call-flows/{id} should return 404, confirming it’s gone. If you call GET /call-flows after deletion, that checklist should no longer appear in the list. This tests the delete operation end-to-end.
- Delete Checklist (Not Found): Call delete on an ID that isn’t present → expect 404. Ensures proper error on invalid deletion.
- After-call Workflow Consistency: Although not a direct unit test of the API, we might simulate the intended usage: for instance, create a checklist and then simulate an agent completing it. However, completion tracking is likely outside the API’s responsibilities, so this would be more of an integration test. As a unit test, we ensure that the definition is stored correctly. One thing we can test unit-wise is that the data model holds multiple tasks. For example, create a checklist with N tasks and ensure that when retrieving, we get all N tasks in the correct order. This is verifying that the tasks array is not truncated or mis-ordered by the create/read operations.
- Security Regression: As with others, we’ll do a final check using a non-privileged token on one of the above operations (like trying to update a checklist) to guarantee that the 403 comes back. Since the security middleware is likely shared, this is mostly to be thorough.
General Authentication & Authorization Tests
In addition to the feature-specific tests, we will include some general tests focusing on authentication and authorization behaviors:
- JWT Verification: If our backend uses JWTs for auth, we will unit test the JWT verification logic separately (mocking a valid token and an invalid token). For instance, ensure that a request with a tampered token signature is rejected with 401. This might be done by directly invoking the auth middleware with a fake request object. The goal is to validate that our authentication middleware correctly distinguishes valid vs invalid tokens.
- Role Extraction: Unit test the function or middleware that checks user roles (e.g., hasRole middleware). We can simulate a request with a user object having role “agent” and one with “admin” and ensure it allows or blocks appropriately. This overlaps with integration tests above, but testing it in isolation can pinpoint issues. For example, given the middleware example in code, we’d assert that hasRole(['admin','manager']) returns 403 for a user role “agent”, and allows for “admin”.
- 401 vs 403 Distinction: We ensure that the app uses 401 Unauthorized for missing/invalid auth and 403 Forbidden for unauthorized role consistently, as per HTTP standards. Tests already cover many instances of this, but we might centralize a few to ensure no scenario returns the wrong code. For example, if a token is expired or missing, the middleware should produce 401 (and our tests assert that); if the token is valid but role wrong, it should produce 403. We will deliberately cause each condition and verify the status code.
- Endpoint Protection Coverage: We will have a test that iterates over all defined routes in these APIs and checks that the authentication middleware is attached. This can be done by inspecting the Express app’s route stack (if using Express) to see if our auth and role-check middleware are present on the Members, Articles, Actions, and Call-flow routes. This is a more programmatic way to ensure no route was accidentally left unprotected. For instance, we expect every route in these groups to include the authenticateToken and role-check in its stack. This kind of test helps catch configuration mistakes.
- Rate Limiting/Security Headers (if any): If the backend includes security features like rate limiting or special headers, we could write tests for those. However, since the question focuses on auth and roles, this might be out of scope. But for completeness: e.g., if we had a rate limiter on these admin routes, we might simulate a burst of requests and ensure it starts rejecting after the threshold with 429 Too Many Requests.
Test Environment and Tools
All the above tests will be written using a testing framework (for example, Jest or Mocha with Supertest for HTTP calls). We will use Supertest to simulate HTTP calls to our API endpoints in a controlled environment. The tests will likely mock the database or use an in-memory database to verify persistence (each test can start with a fresh state).
For authentication, we will either use real JWTs signed with the test secret or stub the auth middleware to accept a dummy user object for simplicity. A common approach is to generate a token for an admin user and one for an agent user in the test setup and use those tokens in the Authorization headers of Supertest requests. We will ensure our tests include the header Authorization: Bearer <token> for the positive cases. For negative cases, we might omit the header or provide an incorrect token.
Example: A snippet of an authentication test might be:
request(app)
  .get('/members')
  .set('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + expiredOrInvalidToken)
  .expect(401);


and another:
request(app)
  .post('/members')
  .set('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + agentToken)  // token for non-admin
  .send(newMemberData)
  .expect(403);


Then a success case with adminToken expecting 201. This aligns with scenarios described (401 for no/invalid token, 403 for wrong role, 2xx for correct role).
Each test will assert not just status codes but also response bodies where applicable (e.g., error message contents, or returned data correctness). We’ll isolate tests so that they don’t depend on each other’s side effects (using fresh data or test database transactions rolled back between tests). This ensures reliability and that one test failing won’t cascade to others.
By covering authentication, authorization, and each route’s main logic (create, read, update, delete including edge cases like not found or validation), this test suite will give us confidence that:
- The APIs are secure by design, only accessible to the intended roles.
- The APIs fulfill their functional requirements (managing members, articles, mappings, and checklists correctly).
- Error conditions are handled gracefully and according to accepted standards (proper HTTP status codes and messages).
- Future changes to these endpoints will be caught by regression tests if they break security or functionality (for example, if someone inadvertently removes the auth check on an endpoint, a test will fail).
In summary, the combination of the route implementations described and the thorough unit tests will ensure a robust backend extension for Members, Articles, Actions, and Call-flow management. Each route behaves as intended and is locked down to prevent unauthorized access, as verified by the suite of tests.
