🛡️ Backend Security Checklist – Deployment Handoff
🔒 API & Middleware Security
| Area | Implementation |
| CORS | Strict origin whitelist with credentials: true |
| Helmet Headers | Enabled to prevent sniffing, framing, and exposure |
| Body Limit | express.json({ limit: '10kb' }) to block oversized POSTs |
| Rate Limiting | Global limiter via express-rate-limit (100 reqs/15min) |
| XSS Sanitization | Enabled via xss-clean in production only |

🔑 Auth & Access Control
| Feature | Status |
| JWT Auth | Scoped per org, expiring access tokens |
| RBAC Middleware | Role-based restrictions for each route (auth + roles) |
| Agent Scope | Can validate and lookup only single members |
| Admin/Manager Scope | Can create members, view escalations, and training logs |

🧠 Member Privacy Model

- ✅ No bulk member lookups exposed
- ✅ All lookups require specific :memberId and matching orgId
- ✅ Member validation requires 2+ matched fields for success
- ✅ Validation limited to agents or training mode only
- ✅ Audit logs or escalation logging can be extended if needed

🧰 Infrastructure & Monitoring
| Control | Notes |
| HTTPS-only | Enforced via proxy / load balancer |
| .env Secrets Rotation | All sensitive tokens refreshed before deploy |
| NODE_ENV | Set to 'production' for all live environments |
| Ingress Monitoring | Alerts on unusual API activity (e.g. bug flood, lookup spam) |
| Logging | Console + optional persistent logs (e.g. escalations, validation) |

🧪 Deployment Safeguards

- ✅ All unit tests passing (npm test)
- ✅ No exposed route for bulk member access
- ✅ Suggesters and training endpoints scoped by role
- ✅ Helmet, CORS, sanitizer applied conditionally per environment
